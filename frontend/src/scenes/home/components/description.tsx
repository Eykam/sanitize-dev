        Here's how it works - users submit their media to the Sanitize.gg
        platform and our advanced AI algorithms quickly detect and censor any
        words or content that may violate the policies of the platform the media
        is intended for. The sanitized media is then returned to the user, ready
        to be uploaded and shared without any concerns about policy violations.
